# Project Image Setup Guide

The website is configured to look for images in the `public/projects/` folder.
Please add your images to this folder and rename them exactly as follows:

1. `residential-solar.jpg`  (For Residential Rooftop Solar)
2. `commercial-solar.jpg`   (For Commercial Solar Power System)
3. `industrial-solar.jpg`   (For Industrial Solar Installation)
4. `hospital-solar.jpg`     (For Hospital Solar Project)
5. `school-solar.jpg`       (For School Solar Installation)
6. `corporate-solar.jpg`    (For Corporate Office Solar System)

**Note:** The images should be in `.jpg` format. If you have `.png` or other formats, rename them in the code (`app/projects/page.tsx`) or convert them.
